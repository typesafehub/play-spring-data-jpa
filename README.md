# DEPRECATED play-spring-data-jpa

**This application is deprecated.**

There is an example JPA template included with Play that can be run with Activator from the command line: 

```
activator new my-jpa-project play-java-intro   
```

If you want to see the java-play-intro project without creating a new template, you can see the project in Play:
